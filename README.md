# ABOUT
**Pihole Manager** came about as I needed away to manage the **[Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/)** without me have to always login or ssh into the server. Most of the time is was just to update the _gravity_ or update the application.

With **Pihole Manager** 90 precent of what I use to have to do is taken care for me.
